#+TITLE: Agent Workspace Provider
#+AUTHOR: DrDos

Docker container for AI agent CLIs (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI).

No ssh or host secrets configured. I want an isolated environment to run all the agents in yolo mode.

* Usage
Install first via install.sh script. Then you should be able to run =agent-workspace= globally. Run =agent-workspace build= once to build the docker image. Then, from any project directory you want, run =agent-workspace run= to get a shell inside your docker container with your pwd mounted to =/workspace=. Feel free to do everything you want there.

You can start the pre-installed agents in yolo mode directly by running:
- =$ agent-workspace run claude-yolo=
- =$ agent-workspace run codex-yolo=
- =$ agent-workspace run gemini-yolo=

See =agent-w.conf.example=.

* Port forwarding
Configurable in =agent-w.conf=. Default: 9000 bound to 127.0.0.1.

* What the install script does
It will create a symlink to the agent-workspace wrapper into your path as well as deploying the config file into your XDG_CONFIG_DIR. The install script asks for the relevant values to tailor the installation to your system.
